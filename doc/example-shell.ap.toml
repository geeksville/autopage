[[match]]
# If any of the following patterns match, this autopage will be shown to the user
# Multiple match tables can be specified, if any of them matches the remainder of this file will
# be used to build a page.
class = "code" # A regex that is matched against the window class (WM_CLASS)
# Other examples
# class = "org.gnome.Ptyxis" (for flatpaks)
# name = "Google Drive.*" # A regex that is matched against the window name (WM_NAME)

[background]
# Defines an (optional) background for the page
# FIXME figure out how to pass in backgrounds in the page JSON

[default]
# Defaults values for buttons that don't specify them explicitly
background = "0x00ff0080" # Greenish

[[button]]

location = "2x1" 
# A grid location for the button, in the format "column x row", if not specified the next empty location
# will be used.  Indexes are zero based, so "0x0" is the top-left button.

icon = ".*next"
# An icon regex that matches against the the specified icon pack, if no pack is specified all packs will be searched

top = "foo"
# A top label (optional)

center = "blah" 
# A center label (optional)

bottom = "bar"
# A bottom label (optional)

background = "0xff2244aa"
# A background color for the button, in RGBA format (optional)

# size = 0.84
# An optional size hint for the icon, where 1.0 is the default size

[[button.action]]
# Each button can contain an array of actions

type = "Ctrl+C"
# A shorthand to type a series of characters (implicitly this uses com_core447_OSPlugin::Hotkey), other examples:
# type = "Ctrl+Shift+T" (to open a new terminal tab)
# type = "Hello SPACE world" (to type out "Hello world")
# Note: 'spaces' are only used to delineate keys, they are not actually typed, 
# If you want to type an actual space, use "SPACE" as shown above.

# id = "com_core447_OSPlugin::Hotkey"
# For more advanced actions you can specify the plugin ID and action name

# settings = { "keys" = [[ 30, 1 ], [ 30, 0 ]] }
# If using the 'id' mechanism you can pass in settings to that plugin via the settings table
