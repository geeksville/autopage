# Misc notes for geeksville

for https://github.com/StreamController/StreamController/issues/548 
* make work with games!
* optionally let autobutton files say they want a full screen
* let autobutton def files specify a screen background which is used if one is not set - for steam games pull this from steam
* allow multiple autobutton groups to show on same screen? i.e. media controls should be included if space allows
* somehow unify with SteamInput and that new bazzite input mapper project?
